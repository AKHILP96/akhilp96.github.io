                                <p class="t-p">I went on the website and I confused by the overall experience. The site had very little visual appeal and it's presentation seemed abit off.</p>
                                <p class="t-p">So I decided to come up with a redesign of Gujarat Tourism official website.</p>

                            <p>To confirm my hypothesis that the website isnt user friendly, I asked 5 people to use the website and asked them to carry out series of various tasks. Following was the general Problems : </p>
                            <p class="t-p">1. Landing page had no visual appeal to it</p>
                            <p class="t-p">2. Navigation bar is laidout horizaontally with a horizontal scroll, this caused navigation submenu to close from time to time and wasn't a good user experience overall.</p>
                            <p class="t-p">3. Landing page is filled with non-essential links.</p>
                            <p class="t-p">4. To many clicks to reach the desired page</p>
                            <p class="t-p">5. Image gallery aren't optimized for control.</p>
                            <p class="t-p">6. Image gallery uses flash player which isn't supported on many devices.</p>
                            <p class="t-p">7. It's wasnt mobile responsive</p>

                    <p class="t-p">5. Removing or delegating non important functionalities to third party services</p>
                    <p class="t-p">6. Instead of making user scroll for details, show all details in one section.</p>

                        <p class="t-p">Initially I was confused as of where to get started so I started out by asking and researching on a very basic questions.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="brainstorming__container__copy">

                        <h4 class="t-h4">Why do we need a landing page?<br> The Marketing aspect</h4>
                        <p>I found out that the main purpose of a landing page was to serve as a marketing tool, in this case it was selling "Why you should visit Gujarat"</p>
                        <p>It should provide enough information to the user while selling the idea of visiting that place.</p>
                        <p>So I decided to breakdown the layout into based on following question</p>
                        <p>What's the unique thing about Gujarat?</p>
                        <p>A Social proof from those who have visited Gujarat</p>
                        <p>What Gujarat has to offer to you?</p>
                        <p>And a conversion goal to booking hotels, tours etc.</p>

                        <h4 class="t-h4">How should I design the layout?<br> The Technical aspects</h4>
                    <p class="t-p">Since it is going to be an Image heavy website, I decided to go with a minimal layout that consists of few images and relevant text content.</p>
                    <p class="t-p">I took inspiration from <strong> Instagram </strong>since it's an image heavy website.</p>
                    <p class="t-p">Based on my understanding, I decided to go with a minimal design that was balanced between images and information</p>

                        <h4 class="t-h4">What features should it have?<br>Keeping it simple</h4>
                    <p>During my reserach, I found that people preferred to book via third part booking websites like yatra, expedia, booking.com etc</p>
                    <p>Also I saw that most of the exsisting tourism website didn't have any booking or login options.</p>
                    <p>This was because they already had offers that they wanted to use, so I decided to remove sign in, sign up and decided to redirect the user whenever they wanted to book a tour or hotel etc.</p>

                        <p class="t-p">I researched about breadcrumbs, pros and cons of using them and how to implement them</p>
                        <p class="t-p">Major thing that stood out was never to create a dynamic breadcrumb since it might confuse the user and also when a user visits the page from an external site, the breadcrumb will be confusing</p>
                        <p class="t-p">So, the best way to implement the breadcrumbs was to design a single canonical breadcrumb depending upon task and main goal</p>
                        <p class="t-p">In the above case since the user is ultimately booking a tour, it made sense to implement breadcrum as home page -> tours page -> tour</p>
